/**
  * Demonstrate the use of [[cats.effect.concurrent.Deferred]]
  *
  * Two processes will try to complete the promise at the same time but only one will succeed,
  * completing the promise exactly once.
  * The loser one will raise an error when trying to complete a promise already completed,
  * that's why we call `attempt` on the evaluation.
  *
  * Notice that the loser process will remain running in the background and the program will
  * end on completion of all of the inner streams.
  *
  * So it's a "race" in the sense that both processes will try to complete the promise at the
  * same time but conceptually is different from "race". So for example, if you schedule one
  * of the processes to run in 10 seconds from now, then the entire program will finish after
  * 10 seconds and you can know for sure that the process completing the promise is going to
  * be the first one.
